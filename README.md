## Before you arrive

Please make sure you do the following steps before the first hands-on session:

0. You will need to download this directory of scripts.
1. You will need to [download the data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7405048).
2. You will need to have an up-to-date version of MNE-Python installed on your machine (you need a *full install* with all dependencies, **not** "MNE-Python with core functionalities only"). See instructions at: https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html
3. To check your installation, please look at the (very short!) notebook [Check your installation](0-Installation_check.ipynb). See below if you need a reminder how to start it.
4. If you are not familiar with Python, we invite you to take the time to work on these tutorials:
[Intro to Python](intro_to_python/0a-Intro_Python.ipynb), [Intro to Numpy](intro_to_python/0b-Intro_Numpy.ipynb).

### Start a Jupyter notebook

 To start a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved this directory of scripts. Then type the command `jupyter notebook` and Jupyter should open in your internet browser. Click on the notebook you want to run!
