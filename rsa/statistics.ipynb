    "While this statistical technique is becoming the standard \"go-to\" method for testing for significant differences between experimental conditions in MEG and EEG studies, applying the technique correctly is not always straightforward and there are a lot of caveats to beware of.\n",
    "On top of this, the API of MNE-Python regarding these tests could use a bit more work.\n",

    "## The purpose of cluster-based permutation testing\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring differences between conditions, a good first step is to perform separate t-tests for each channel/sourcepoint/timepoint and visualize them.\n",
    "While this gives you a good feel of where and when significant differences may occur, one cannot always make solid statistical inferences based on these values.\n",
    "Cluster-based permutation testing is designed to solve two problems that arise when using mass t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The multiple-comparisons problem: solved by using a cluster-based statistic\n",
    " 2. The non-Gaussian data problem: solved by using random permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions to these problems come at a hefty price though: the test can only infer the data is different between conditions. **The test can not be used to infer when and where there is a significant difference.**\n",
    "Researchers get this wrong a lot.\n",
    "The Fieldtrip manual even has a [dedicated page about this](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_not_to_interpret_results_from_a_cluster-based_permutation_test) which I encourage you to read.\n",
